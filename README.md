# Analysis of Drop in Yammerâ€™s User Engagement  

- This project investigates the reasons for the decline in user engagement on Yammer, utilizing PostgreSQL for data analysis and Excel for data visualization. 
- The analysis was conducted on the **Mode platform** due to its report-building capabilities, although the queries are fully compatible with **pgAdmin** or any PostgreSQL environment.

## Key Highlights  

### Data Processing & Exploration  
- Processed and explored data using **data manipulation commands (DQL)** and **aggregate functions**.  
- Utilized logical and arithmetic operators for deriving key insights.  

### Data Analysis Techniques  
- Performed in-depth analysis with:  
  - **Joins** for combining multiple datasets.  
  - **Window functions** for ranking and aggregation across partitions.  
  - **Subqueries** for modularizing complex queries.  
  - **Temporary tables** to enhance readability and maintainability.  
- Exported processed data to CSV format for visualization.  

### Visualizations  
- Created dynamic charts in Excel to illustrate key findings and trends.  

## Outcomes  
- Identified the primary causes of declining user engagement.  
- Provided actionable recommendations to improve engagement.
